            <p>What We Do</p>
            <p>The PS 75 PTA, Ltd. After School Program is a full service child-care and enrichment after school program that was designed by PS 75 parents to serve the PS 75 parent community.  We are an independent, not-for-profit organization operating on the premises of PS 75 located at 96th Street and West End Avenue on the Upper West Side of Manhattan.  Our well-established and highly regarded program received the esteemed Blackboard award in 2007.  We offer the convenience of in-school pick-up and the safety of constant child-care and supervision until 6pm, five days a week, with special programs providing child care on school Half Days.  Our quality after school program offers two child-care options: AFTERCARE and ENRICHMENT; both of which are extremely affordable.  Our flexible approach allows families to combine both Aftercare and Enrichment Class options to suit their needs and interests.</p>

            <p>Aftercare</p>
            <p>The AFTERCARE Program, designed to provide full time child-care for working parents, provides loosely structured, creative, recreational activities that allow your child to be a kid, have fun, and be a part of a club-like community.  Children are organized by grade into small groups with two adult counselors per group who actively engage the children in all of their activities such as snack, supervised homework Time, Sports & Group Games, Arts & Crafts, Free Play & Relax Time, Playground Time, Board Games, Story Time & Individual Reading, Five Themed Festivals per year, and special Club Days.  Parents have the flexibility to opt in and out of this option as needed from a “Per Day” basis for just a few hours of emergency child care to “Full Time” coverage two, three, four, or five days a week.  This option serves parents the entire school year, beginning on the first day of school in September through the last full week of school in June and can be combined with our popular ENRICHMENT option.

            <p>Enrichment</p>
            <p>The ENRICHMENT Program is designed to provide PS 75 students with exposure to recreational, academic, and intellectual experiences that will expand and enhance their elementary education experience.  Offering a wide range of after school classes in art, ceramics, dance, chess, music, cooking, practical arts, small group tutoring, sports, and science, the PS 75 After School Program contracts with reputable organizations and teachers from around the New York metropolitan area, some of whom are nationally recognized, and all of whom specialize in teaching children relevant, age-appropriate, safe and enriching activities.  Most of these classes are held on the premises of PS 75.  Our After School Program provides an Assistant Teacher for each class to ensure a small group with a low student – teacher ratio.  This option serves parents from October through May in three 9-week sessions and can be combined with our wonderful AFTERCARE option.  Enrichment classes are held Mondays through Thursdays ONLY with no classes on Fridays.
